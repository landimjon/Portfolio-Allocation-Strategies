<h1 align="center"> Portfolio-Allocation-Strategies</h1> 

The Equal Weight, Modern Portfolio Optimisation (MPT), and Conservative portfolio allocation strategies are compared in this study. Its objectives are to evaluate their eligibility for investment management and analyze their performance using past financial data. While the MPT strategy uses mathematical optimization techniques to maximize return or minimize risk, the Equal Weight strategy gives each asset in the portfolio an equal weight. Conservative Allocation prioritizes stability by investing heavily in less volatile assets like bonds, favoring income and security over potentially higher returns from stocks and REITs. The project analyses and visualizes data to assess essential performance indicators for each strategy, including return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. The results will help with portfolio optimization and investment management decision-making processes by offering investors, financial experts, and researchers insightful information.

-	Yahoo Finance

-	Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

-	Bloomberg

-	Reuters

## Data Structure

-  `year`: Year of the data record (2023-2024)

<br>

## Analysis

The analysis includes:

-  Based on your risk tolerance, the code creates a conservative portfolio comprising 10% REITs, 10% equities, and 80% bonds.
-  It downloads historical price data and calculates daily returns for each asset class.
-  The code uses metrics like annualized return, standard deviation, and Sharpe Ratio to analyze portfolio performance.
-  It offers a performance report and an optional plot of the portfolio's daily returns for visualization purposes.
- The results will offer insightful information to investors, financial experts, and researchers, helping them make informed decisions about portfolio optimization and investment management.

## Execution Order

<br>

To properly run the Shiny app, execute the scripts in the following order:
1. `Heurst_PVC_Class_1.R`
2. `Heurst_PVC_Class_2.R`
3. `Heurst_PVC_Class_3.R`
4. `Heurst_PVC_Class_4.R`
5. `comparisons.R`
6. `decision.R` 
7. `function_cart_graph.R`
8. `decision_with_map.R `
9. `TSP.R` (Run this script last)

## Running the Shiny App

<br>

1. Once all the scripts have been executed successfully, locate and open the `TSP.R` script.
2. Run the `TSP.R` script and wait for approximately 2 minutes.
3. The Shiny app will progressively load and display a map, itinerary, and statistical tables for testing and comparing the heuristics used.

This Shiny app uses American bonds, REITs, and stocks to walk you through the analysis of a diversified and conservative portfolio approach. How can we use it? Let's explore!

## Using the Shiny App

-	Open the App: To start examining a diversified and conservative portfolio strategy, open the Shiny app.

-	Explore Allocation: The program first shows an 80/10/10 sample allocation (Bonds, REITs, and stocks).

-	Customise Allocation: Enter your preferred bond allocation (within a reasonable range) using the text box or slider that is provided.

-	Dynamic Analysis: The program recalculates performance indicators dynamically based on your selected bond allocation.

-	Performance Insights: Based on your input, view essential indicators, including the Sharpe Ratio, standard deviation, and annualized return.

-	Visualise Returns: A line chart shows the portfolio's daily returns over time to help you understand possible swings.
