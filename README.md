# Portfolio-Allocation-Strategies

# Overview #
The Equal Weight and Modern Portfolio Optimisation (MPT) portfolio allocation strategies are compared in this study. Its objectives are to evaluate their eligibility for investment management and analyse their performance using past financial data. While the MPT strategy uses mathematical optimisation techniques to maximise return or minimise risk, the Equal Weight strategy gives each asset in the portfolio an equal weight. The project analyses and visualises dataÂ to assess important performance indicators for each strategy, including return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. The results will help with portfolio optimisation and investment management decision-making processes by offering insightful information to investors, financial experts, and researchers.
## Key Features ##

- Comparison of Equal Weight and Modern Portfolio Optimization strategies.
- Analysis of performance metrics including return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.
- Backtesting allocation strategies using historical financial data.
- Visualization of portfolio allocation results using RStudio.
- Recommendations for portfolio optimization based on analysis findings.
